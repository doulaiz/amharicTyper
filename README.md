***AmharicTyper*** is a Jquery plugin that implements an Amharic/Geez interpreter inside an input HTML element. 

It allows an user to write in fidels in Amharic or other Ethiopian languages.

With this plugin, the user can simply write phoneticallyusing the Western alphabet and see the interpretation into fidels.


# How to use
1. Just add the class **amharic-typer** to your input HTML element, and you are good to go. 
> \<input class="amharic-typer">
2. If you want to display traditional Amharic punctuation, add the class **amharic-punctuation** to your input element.
> \<input class="amharic-typer amharic-punctuation">
3. When the final users write in the input element, a dropdown will appear with the possible interpretations in fidels. Using the SPACE BAR, ENTER, a NUMBER or the ARROWS will select the desired fidels.
